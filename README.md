- Others small features...

Tech used:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose

- Cloudinary API & Multer

SIDE-NOTE:
I have created my own Auth System... I know I should never create my own Authentication and Authorization system, but this is not a production project
and I do that just for fun (just like the entire project anyway).

-> I'm updating more this project from time to time.
