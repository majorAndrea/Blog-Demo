# Blog-Demo.

My first full-stack webdev RESTFul project.

Tech used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Express Session & MongoStore v3
- Bootstrap
- EJS and some npm packages related to EJS
- Cloudinary API & Multer
- MapBox API
- CSFR Tokens
- JOI Validation
- Sanitize HTML (configured to work with JOI)
- Helmet
- Bcrypt.js

I have created my own Auth System... I know I should never create my own Authentication and Authorization system, but this is not a serious project
and I do that just for fun (just like the entire project anyway).

-> I'm updating more this project from time to time.
